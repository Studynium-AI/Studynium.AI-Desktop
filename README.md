# The Desktop Version of Studynium AI

currently just a server with the api exposed at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

Features:
- RAG using Langchain.
- Implemented ollama integration for running the ai locally.
- FastAPI based server to expose the app across the system.

## Note:
due to a lot of committments from my college life i have currently paused the development of this... i am planning to continue development from June 2026..
